# This script allows a robot to find the shortest path through a maze that is saved in memory, and then track a line to solve the same maze in the physical world and by using the shortest path.
# This is done using RobotC to run through all possiblee paths through the mazee to find the shortest, then using an EV3 controller to solve the physical maze using a light sensor to track the maze lines.
# The robot is then able to accurately find its way through a complex maze and while also showing its current position in the maze on its screen.


1. what can your robot do?
Our robot saves the the line maze information (dimensions and paths) in its memory, then uses the lines as a guide to 
follow to solve the maze while displaying the movement in the brick screen. Given a starting point, and a target point, 
the robot solves the maze then calculates the shortest path solution in its memory. Then the robot physically follows the 
shortest path to the target. While the robot is calculating the shortest path, the robot screen shows the status of the 
program graphically on the screen and finally moves towards the target using this path.

2. what can't your robot do?
Our robot is not capable of solving the maze using a horizontal moving colour sensor.

3. Other comments you wish to forward to developers working on this project in the future, or users of your product.
Rely on using encoder values for the movement of the robot as the gyroscope will complicate the maze solver and 
create more errors along the way. Also, the moving colour sensor is not needed to solve this project.
